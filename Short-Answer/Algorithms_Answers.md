#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
The running time is infinity for all value of n>=0. This is because for every value of n=>0 the while  loop condition returns true and as long as the condition is true, the loop will continue to execute

b)

The running time is O(n*log(n))

c)

The running time is O(n) since it increases linearly with increase in bunnies
